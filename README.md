# HistoReg
This repository describes a framework for automated registration of variably-stained digitized histology slices from various anatomical sites, based on a greedy diffeomorphic registration tool.

The dataset provided for the quantitative evaluation of the proposed approach was provided by the Automatic Non-rigid Histological Image Registration (ANHIR) challenge [2-6]. This challenge was a part of the IEEE International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging (ISBI) 2019 conference.
# Build Requirements 

- git
- CMake version
- C++ compiler (ex: make on linux)
- ITK

c3d package (itksnap.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php?n=Downloads.C3D)


# Download and Compile

Showing an example set of commands to download and compile HistoReg on a Linux machine (analogous steps apply for Windows machines):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/CBICA/HistoReg.git HistoReg
# git checkout cpp_conversion -  (Move cpp version to main ? What to do with bash version ?)
cd HistoReg
git submodule init 
git submodule update
mkdir bin
cd bin
ccmake ..
make -j 8
```

# Run
./HistoReg --help : Print help

./HistoReg -m /path/to/moving/image -f /path/to/fix/image -o /path/to/output/dir/ -c if c3d not yet included : Compute registration metrics between moving and target images with the default parameters used for the ANHIR challenge, add -S or -F option to apply transformations respectively to resampled or full size images.
